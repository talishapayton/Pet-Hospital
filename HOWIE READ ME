CSS: When trying to implement CSS layouts to match, it broke my functionality so it looks almost the same as midterm. 

Scenarios to test: 
-As a pet owner create and account and add some pets. 
-Login as a doctor and view the pet, that was added. Set an initial appt to see the pets. 
-Login with the account you created to see appts and notes that were added by the doctor.
